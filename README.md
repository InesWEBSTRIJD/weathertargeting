# weathertargeting
I am trying to install a weather targeting script in Google Ads. Through this script, i can automate increased biddings in regions where it is raining for a client that sells rain jackets. However, the script is not running correctly and both the Google support team and the provider of the weather API key are unable to assist me any further.
